<h2>Overview</h2>
Performance tests of the OpenDDS implementation was performed and the results are presented here.  This testing was done using the pre-release code for OpenDDS version 2.1.  The <a class="externalLink null" href="test_environment.html">equipment</a> used included multiple Suse Linux hosts with Intel architecture processors and standard network equipment.<br><br>The testing was performed using the OpenDDS-Bench performance testing framework.  This framework is currently located at <em>$DDS_ROOT/performance-tests/Bench</em>.  The configuration files for these tests are included in the OpenDDS download file and can be used to repeat the testing in a users environment.  This will let users compare existing or other candidate data transport mechanisms in their specific target environment.<br><br>Currently the results are for <a class="externalLink null" href="latency_tests.html">latency testing</a>.  As additional tests are completed, the results will be included here as well.  For latency testing, data traverses a loop through two hosts and measurements for both originating and terminating times are made within the same process.<br>
