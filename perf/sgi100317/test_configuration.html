<h2>Test Configuration</h2>
Testing using the OpenDDS-Bench performance testing framework is based on the use of configuration files to specify the behavior and topology of the test.  It is possible to define the configuration files using the <em>freemind</em> graphical capture tool, which is described <a class="externalLink null" href="futurelink.html">elsewhere</a>.  There are three basic types of configuration file used for the testing.  These are: service configuration files, used to dynamically link the transport implementation libraries; transport configuration files, used to configure the instances of transports for the test processes, and; test configuration files, used to establish the test conditions and topology.  These are briefly described here.<br><h1>Service Configuration Files</h1>The transport implementations are provided in OpenDDS via dynamically linked libraries.  While it is possible to link these statically into the test application, typically these are linked into the service at execution time via the service configuration file.  For these tests, the file <em>etc/svc.conf</em> is provided to link all of the available transports into the test process.  The contents of this file are:<br><blockquote><pre>dynamic DCPS_SimpleTcpLoader Service_Object * SimpleTcp:_make_DCPS_SimpleTcpLoader() "-type SimpleTcp"
dynamic OpenDDS_DCPS_Udp_Service Service_Object * OpenDDS_Udp:_make_UdpLoader()
dynamic OpenDDS_DCPS_Multicast_Service Service_Object * OpenDDS_Multicast:_make_MulticastLoader()
</pre></blockquote><span><center>$DDS_ROOT/performance-tests/Bench/etc/svc.conf</center></span><br><h1>Transport Configuration Files</h1>The transport configuration files specify the specific configuration of transport instances by instance key.  Each transport used within a test will have a transport key associated with it, and that key is configured with a section in a transport configuration file.  Typically a single transport configuration file is used per test, with each process selecting the appropriately configured transport instances that it uses from the file.  The following table shows the transport configuration files provided in the <em>etc</em> directory for use during testing.<br><table class="twtable"><caption align="bottom"> Files in $DDS_ROOT/performance-tests/Bench/etc </caption><tbody><tr class="evenRow"><td align="center">File</td><td align="center">Description</td></tr><tr class="oddRow"><td align="center">transport.ini</td><td align="left">general purpose configuration file defining 10 transport instances of each type</td></tr><tr class="evenRow"><td align="center">transport-tcp.ini</td><td align="left">configures transport instances using the <strong><em>SimpleTcp</em></strong> transport type</td></tr><tr class="oddRow"><td align="center">transport-udp.ini</td><td align="left">configures transport instances using the <strong><em>Udp</em></strong> transport type<br>due to the nature of this transport implementation, this file will need to be tailored for each test host on which it is used</td></tr><tr class="evenRow"><td align="center">transport-multi-be.ini</td><td align="left">configures transport instances using the <strong><em>Multicast</em></strong> transport type to operate in best effort mode</td></tr><tr class="oddRow"><td align="center">transport-multi-rel.ini</td><td align="left">configures transport instances using the <strong><em>Multicast</em></strong> transport type to operate in reliable mode</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Test Configuration Files</h1>The test configuration files used for each test are unique are are defined as part of the OpenDDS-Bench performance test framework.  Each test will have a configuration file to be used for each test process for each test case.  The configuration files specify both the DDS Quality of Service policy values for each Entity in the test process and the test specific configuration for that process and those Entities.  The data which can be specified in these configuration files is defined in the <em><a class="externalLink null" href="data_model.html">$DDS_ROOT/performance-tests/Bench/doc/datamodel.txt</a></em> file.
